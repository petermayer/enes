EnEs
====

This application is a little tool for password security analysis. It can be used to calculate multiple different metrics to analyze the distribution of password sets. The following types of passwords are supported: text passwords and graphical click-based passwords. The following methods are available: 

* Text methods 
	* Shanon entropy - Shay et al. [1]
* Graphical click-based methods 
	* Shanon entropy - Dirik et al. [2]
	* Î±-guesswork - Bonneau [3]
