This application provides multiple methods to analyze the entropy of password sets of different types. Entropy estimates can be obtained for text passwords and graphical click-based passwords. The following methods are available: 

* Text methods 
	* Shanon entropy - Shay et al. [1]
* Graphical click-based methods 
	* Shanon entropy - Dirik et al. [2]
