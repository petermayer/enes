EnEs
====

This application is a little tool for password security analysis. It can be used to calculate multiple different metrics to analyze the distribution of password sets. The following types of passwords are supported: text passwords and graphical click-based passwords. The following methods are available: 

* Text methods 
	* Shanon entropy - Shay et al. [1]
* Graphical click-based methods 
	* Shanon entropy - Dirik et al. [2]
	* Î±-guesswork - Bonneau [3]

Usage Instructions
------------------
To use EnEs simply build a jar-file using your favorite IDE and run the program as follows:

`java -jar enes.jar -m <estimation method> -i <password file> [-o <output file>] [-v]`

`-m` Estimation method to use. The naming scheme for methods is `<password type>[_<password subtype>]_<metric>[_<submetric>]`. For example, to estimate the entropy for a set of click-based graphical passwords where the choice of click-points can be assumed to be independent from one another the respective method is `gp_click_entropy_indep`. The available methods are: `text_entropy`, `gp_click_entropy_dep`, `gp_click_entropy_indep`, `gp_click_guesswork`.
	
`-i` Path to password file

`-o` Path to output file (optional)

`-v` Enable verbose output (optional, default: print overall entropy estimate only)

`-h` Print help text

`-l` Print license information
